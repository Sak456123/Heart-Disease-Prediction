# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Researched and implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naives Bayes, Support
 Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors , XG Boost and Random Forest to identify the most effective approach for
 prediction.
Developed a highly accurate heart disease prediction model with a 96% accuracy rate by Using Smote and Hyperparameter Tuning Method.
Preprocessed and cleaned medical datasets to ensure data quality also Applied, EDA, feature engineering techniques to enhance
 model accuracy, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
 Successfully reduced the data training time while maintaining high model accuracy.
